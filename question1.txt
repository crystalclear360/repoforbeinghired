1 - What's function composition?


In Maths, the composition of a function is an operation where two functions say f and g generate a new function
say h in such a way that h(x) = g(f(x)). It means here function g is applied to the function of x.
So, basically, a function is applied to the result of another function.


A composite function is generally a function that is written inside another function.
Composition of a function is done by substituting one function into another function.
For example, f [g (x)] is the composite function of f (x) and g (x).
